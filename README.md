### �� Fake News Detection using Neural Networks
Problem Statement
Fake news is a serious issue in today’s digital landscape. With the explosion of social media and
online content, misinformation spreads faster than ever, influencing public opinion and
disrupting social harmony. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can
automatically detect and classify news articles as Fake or Real using natural language
processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models.
